# Tear down every CDK stack belonging to the GlueAgent dev environment.
#
# Use this whenever you want to stop paying for the deployed dev stack —
# NAT gateway (~$32/mo), RDS instance, ALBs, etc. all go away. Existing
# Postgres data and ECR images go with them by default; this is dev,
# not prod.
#
# What this DOESN'T touch:
#   - The CDK bootstrap stack (CDKToolkit) — leave alone unless you're
#     decommissioning the AWS account.
#   - Resources outside the GlueAgent-* prefix.
#   - CloudWatch log groups (they have their own retention; cheap to leave).
#
# Re-deploying after a teardown re-runs `cdk deploy` from `infra/` and
# starts fresh. Phase 5's deploy scripts will rebuild and push images.

Worth a glance to be sure your bill stops:
  - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home  (filter by tag Project=GlueAgent)
  - ECR repos: any retained images you may want to delete by hand
  - CloudWatch log groups: don't cost much but linger; delete if pedantic
  - RDS automated/manual snapshots: only exist if you took them; check the RDS console

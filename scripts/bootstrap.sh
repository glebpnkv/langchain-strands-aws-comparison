# First-time deploy bootstrap.
#
# Solves the chicken-and-egg between the Ecr stack (creates the ECR
# repos) and the Compute stack (creates ECS services that pull
# `:latest` from those repos and block CFN until the service reaches
# steady state). Pushing images BEFORE Compute is created avoids the
# stuck-CFN deadlock.
#
# Three phases:
#   1. Deploy the prerequisite stacks: Network, Data, Ecr, Auth.
#      This creates the ECR repos so we can push images.
#   2. Build + push agent and frontend images via deploy.sh. Compute
#      services don't exist yet, so deploy.sh runs in push-only mode
#      automatically (no ECS rollout).
#   3. Deploy the Compute stack. ECS services come up with images
#      already in ECR, so they reach steady state on the first pull
#      and CFN finishes cleanly.
#
# After this completes, all subsequent rollouts are just:
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh agent | frontend | all
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run after a failed bootstrap. Steps 1 and 3
# are no-ops when the stacks are already up to date; step 2 always
# rebuilds + pushes (cheap with Docker layer cache).
#
# Env knobs:
#   STAGE        default Dev   (must match the CDK stage)

[OK] Bootstrap complete.

Next steps:
  - Add yourself as a Cognito user (admins invite by email):
      aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
        --user-pool-id "$(aws ssm get-parameter \
          --name /glue-agent/dev/cognito/user-pool-id \

        --user-attributes Name=email,Value=<your-email> Name=email_verified,Value=true \
        --desired-delivery-mediums EMAIL
  - Visit https://<domain_name> (the value pinned in infra/cdk.json).
  - Future rollouts: ./scripts/deploy.sh agent | frontend | all
